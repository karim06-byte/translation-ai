There’s a publishing house that already has a large collection of English → Azerbaijani translations done by its own editors.
Now they want to train an AI model using their previous translations so that the model learns their unique translation style, tone, and terminology.

After training, editors will be able to use a UI where they:

See both the original text and the AI-translated text;

If they don’t like a specific translated section, they can select that part and re-translate it using Gemini or ChatGPT;

The new translation overrides the old one in the database.

The main goal is to:

Preserve the publisher’s translation style in all future translations.

Measure and prove (through metrics) that the model’s outputs mostly come from their data — e.g., “70% of this translation style is ours.”

Ensure that the linguistic concept and stylistic consistency remain intact.

Speed (GPU) is not a priority — accuracy and quality are.

⚙️ Technical Approach
1. Model Type

The most suitable models for this use case are translation-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs) that can be fine-tuned:

MarianMT (Helsinki-NLP) – good for EN→AZ fine-tuning.

M2M100 (Facebook) – supports multilingual translation, including Azerbaijani.

NLLB-200 (Meta) – excellent for low-resource languages like Azerbaijani.

Llama-3 fine-tuned with LoRA adapters – can be used to preserve custom translation tone and style.

The recommended model for this case:

🏆 NLLB-200 fine-tuned with LoRA adapters

This model gives the best results in preserving linguistic nuance and supports metric-based evaluation easily.

🧰 Data Preparation Process

Collect parallel corpora:

English → Azerbaijani pairs from previous book translations.

Store them as key-value pairs:

{ "source": "English sentence", "target": "Azerbaijani translation" }


Cleaning and preprocessing:

Remove HTML tags, footnotes, OCR noise.

Normalize Azerbaijani characters (ə, ğ, ı, ö, ü, ç, ş).

Sentence tokenization using SentencePiece or nltk.

Splitting the dataset:

80% training, 10% validation, 10% testing.

Optional style tagging:

Tag by genre (e.g., “literary”, “academic”, “children’s literature”).

Helps model adapt to stylistic variations.

📊 Metrics (Evaluation and Insight)

To prove the model works correctly and preserves the style:

A. Quality Metrics

BLEU, ChrF, TER — Compare model translations with human ones.
(Library: sacrebleu)

B. Stylistic Similarity

Use sentence embeddings (from sentence-transformers) to measure cosine similarity between AI and human translations.

Analyze n-gram frequency, sentence length, word complexity, and terminology frequency.

C. Data Attribution

To show how much of the model’s translation comes from the publisher’s data:

Use Influence Functions or Embedding similarity distribution to estimate that “70% of the style is derived from the publisher’s data.”

D. Style Memory Check

Periodically compare new translations with historical data to ensure the model’s stylistic drift is minimal.

🔁 System Flow

Data Preparation → Collect and clean translation pairs.

Model Fine-tuning → Train NLLB-200 with LoRA adapters on prepared data.

Evaluation → Run BLEU, ChrF, and stylistic metrics.

UI Interaction:

Editor uploads an English text.

AI generates Azerbaijani translation.

The editor can view, compare, and modify the translation.

If unsatisfied, the editor selects text and re-translates via Gemini or ChatGPT.

The overridden text is stored in the DB and logged for retraining.

Retraining (Continuous Learning)

A nightly cron job retrains the model with newly corrected translations.

Style embeddings are updated so the model keeps learning the publisher’s evolving tone.

Monitoring & Logging

Track BLEU/ChrF over time to detect performance drift.

Maintain a dashboard (e.g., Metabase or Grafana).

🧩 Outcome

The model produces translations that sound like the publisher’s editors.

Quantitative metrics prove that 70%+ of the stylistic fingerprint originates from the publisher’s own translation dataset.

The system continues to learn and refine its tone as editors make corrections.
